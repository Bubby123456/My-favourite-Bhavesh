        <div><p>That is me. My favourite hobby is to capture photos (PHOTOGRAPHY)
            I took some amazing photographs and I embeded them in my previous webpage. Photography is also an art. It can make us recall our memories. Thee image is took by my father we both enjoy a lot taking photographs and not only serious photographs but also funny ones. We both took an image of my friend just when he fell down. In our tour of mussouri I took a photograph of my father when he was hitting me with an iceball. We recall those memories a lot and these give us a pleasant mood. We can observe the beauty of nature only with photography. The picture above is in our tour of Ooti,Kurumba Tamilnadu. I was holding a tree because,I fell off climbing the stone there, to get some support from the tree.  </p></div>
